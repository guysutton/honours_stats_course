# Material for Rhodes University R Stats Course

All the materials required for the Rhodes University R Stats course are deposited here. Well, at least the module on general linear models (GLM's). 


## How to use this repository? 

On this page, you will see a green button saying 'clone or download'. Click this button, download this file to your PC. You will then have to extract/unzip the file, and you will then have all the files and R scripts to reproduce the analyses I performed in the videos. 

* You should open the .Rproj file in the yellow folder, this will open an R script, and then you are good to go. 

## Required readings

I recommend that everyone read the following paper. Please send me an email if you can't get access to the paper. Use the Rhodes University Google Scholar Portal (access via the RU library page).
